# Weekly dinner planner
Web application of my own idea, my very first app created entirely by me to practice JS and CSS.

It's a simple app, made to help planning dinners for current week. Create a list of your favourite meals, assign them to chosen day of a week and send it to Your email! No idea what's for dinner today? Take a look at "Get inspired" section!
